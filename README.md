Tests are defined according to the given specifications from Flux:

    This test is a chance for you to show us how you write automation code.

    The test needs to be written in code and not using a tool but you may use the programming language you think is most          appropriate.

    Please post your code to a GitHub repository and share the details with us. Also include any instructions or documentation we need to be able to run your tests.

    The test is as follows:

    Using the TradeMe Sandbox web site write automation code which does the following:

    ·         Return how many named brands of used car are available in the TradeMe UsedCarscategory.
    ·         Check that the brand ‘Kia’ exists and return the current number of Kia cars listed.
    ·         Check that the brand ‘Hispano Suiza’ does not exist.
